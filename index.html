<p class="essays" id="essays">The butterfly effect in the chaos theory tells us that even a minute event can overturn a major decision with its influence. It shows that everything in the world are connected to each other one way or the other. Through my thesis project, I hope to inspire people to pay attention to the exploratory style of their their thinking process and recognize the power of their decisions. My thesis is a visual representation of the interconnectivity of the world and a mind map that represents the circulation of thoughts. It attracts people to take a break to digest the information they perceive, and visualize the fact that every decision we make is connected to each other. The content of my thesis is inspired by the “Impossible bottle”, which is a seemingly small structure that contains endless information, just like our minds. If you take a closer look at it, you will find a beautiful little world.
