<p class="essays" id="essays">My thesis statement is to make some visual outcomes that can make people feel curious to make them stop and think about this thesis project. I want to attract people’s attention to give themselves a break to digest the information they perceive. Furthermore, I want the audience to have a subjective attitude to consider the reliability of the news and bring this attitude to their daily lives. The main content that I choose is called “Impossible bottle” from Wikipedia. The reason why I want these objects because there is a mini world in a bottle, just like my poster, which means If you look closely at this work, you will also find a beautiful little planet. An impossible bottle is a type of mechanical puzzle. The term refers to any bottle containing an object that does not appear to fit through the bottle’s mouth. The ship in a bottle is a traditional type of impossible bottle. Other common objects include fruits, matchboxes, decks of cards, tennis balls, racketballs, Rubik’s Cubes, padlocks, knots, and scissors. These may be placed inside the bottle using various mechanisms, including constructing an object inside the bottle from smaller parts, using a small object that expands or grows inside the bottle, or molding the glass around the object.
